# Fix the dev container publish step

## Summary

Fixes #50

The devcontainer publish workflow was failing because the Dockerfile referenced a `scripts/` directory that was removed in #26.

## Changes

- **Dockerfile**: Inlined the installation commands directly instead of copying the deleted `scripts/` directory:
  - Install wasmtime via the official install script
  - Install `cargo-component` and `wkg` via cargo

- **devcontainer.json**: Updated the image reference from `ghcr.io/asw101/rust-wasi-hello-devcontainer:latest` to `ghcr.io/bytecodealliance/sample-wasi-http-rust-devcontainer:latest` to match the workflow's published image path.

## Testing

- [ ] Trigger the `publish-devcontainer.yml` workflow manually via `workflow_dispatch`
- [ ] Verify the image builds and pushes successfully to `ghcr.io/bytecodealliance/sample-wasi-http-rust-devcontainer`
- [ ] Open the repository in a GitHub Codespace to confirm the devcontainer works
